# Client Management System - Implementation Summary

**Date Implemented:** October 2025
**Commit:** 694b929
**Status:** ✅ Fully Operational

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive multi-tenant Client Management System that allows the SaaS platform to manage multiple clients with separate sender configurations, email quotas, and campaign tracking.

## Key Features

### 1. Client Management
- **Full CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, Delete clients
- **Client List Page:** `/clients/` - Dashboard with stats cards
- **Client Detail Page:** `/clients/view/<id>` - Individual client overview with campaigns
- **Toggle Active/Inactive Status:** Soft enable/disable clients
- **Modern UI:** Bootstrap modals for confirmations (no JavaScript alerts)

### 2. Client Properties
Each client has:
- Company Information (name, domain, industry)
- Sender Configuration (sender_email, sender_name, reply_to_email)
- Email Provider Settings (brevo_api_key, brevo_sender_id)
- Usage Tracking (monthly_email_limit, emails_sent_this_month)
- Subscription Management (subscription_tier: basic/pro/enterprise)
- Active/Inactive status
- Notes field for internal documentation

### 3. Campaign Integration
- Campaigns can be linked to clients via `client_id` foreign key
- Campaigns inherit sender configuration from their associated client
- Client detail page shows all associated campaigns with analytics

## Database Schema

### Client Model (`models/database.py` lines 453-520)
```python
class Client(db.Model):
    id = Integer (Primary Key)
    company_name = String(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
    domain = String(255)
    industry = String(100)
    sender_email = String(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
    sender_name = String(255) NOT NULL
    reply_to_email = String(255)
    brevo_api_key = String(255)
    brevo_sender_id = String(100)
    is_active = Boolean DEFAULT True
    subscription_tier = String(50) DEFAULT 'basic'
    monthly_email_limit = Integer DEFAULT 1000
    emails_sent_this_month = Integer DEFAULT 0
    created_at = DateTime
    updated_at = DateTime
    notes = Text
```

### Campaign Model Update
- Added `client_id` column (Integer, Foreign Key to clients.id)
- Relationship: `campaign.client` → Client object
- Relationship: `client.campaigns` → List of campaigns

## File Structure

### Routes
- **`routes/clients.py`** - Main client management routes
  - `GET /clients/` - List all clients
  - `GET /clients/create` - Create client form
  - `POST /clients/create` - Save new client
  - `GET /clients/edit/<id>` - Edit client form
  - `POST /clients/edit/<id>` - Update client
  - `GET /clients/view/<id>` - View client details
  - `POST /clients/delete/<id>` - Delete client
  - `POST /clients/toggle/<id>` - Toggle active status
  - `GET /clients/api/list` - JSON API for client list
  - `GET /clients/api/<id>` - JSON API for single client
  - `GET /clients/api/stats` - JSON API for client statistics

### Templates
- **`templates/clients/list.html`** - Client list with stats and table
- **`templates/clients/create.html`** - Create new client form
- **`templates/clients/edit.html`** - Edit existing client form
- **`templates/clients/view.html`** - Client detail page with campaigns
- **`templates/base.html`** (lines 88-94) - Navigation link to Clients

### Models
- **`models/database.py`** - Client model and Campaign.client_id relationship

### Configuration
- **`app.py`** (line 21) - Import clients_bp
- **`app.py`** (line 88) - Register clients blueprint

## Migration Instructions

### For Existing Databases
Run the migration script to add the clients table and client_id column:

```bash
python migrate_existing_db.py
```

This script:
1. Creates the `clients` table if it doesn't exist
2. Adds `client_id` column to `campaigns` table if it doesn't exist
3. Safe to run multiple times (idempotent)

### For New Installations
The Client table is created automatically on first run via:
```python
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
```

## Navigation Access

The Clients link appears in the main navigation menu:
- Location: Between "Campaigns" dropdown and notifications
- Icon: Building icon (fa-building)
- Route: `/clients/`
- Template: `templates/base.html` lines 88-94

## Important Implementation Notes

### 1. Modern UI/UX
- **No JavaScript Alerts:** Uses Bootstrap modals for all confirmations
- **Success/Error Notifications:** Bootstrap alert boxes at top of page
- **Responsive Design:** Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Color-Coded Actions:**
  - Toggle Status → Yellow/Warning button
  - Delete → Red/Danger button
  - View → Blue/Info button
  - Edit → Blue/Primary button

### 2. Template Caching Issue
- **Issue:** Flask's Jinja2 template cache sometimes doesn't refresh automatically
- **Solution:** Restart Flask after template changes to clear cache
- **Command:** Kill all Python processes, then restart app.py

### 3. Validation
Client creation/editing validates:
- Company name is unique
- Sender email is unique and valid format
- All required fields are present
- Monthly email limit is positive integer

### 4. Soft Delete
Clients are not immediately deleted from database. Instead:
- `is_active` field is set to False
- Client data is preserved for historical campaign records
- Can be re-activated later if needed

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Client
1. Navigate to `/clients/`
2. Click "Add New Client"
3. Fill in company information
4. Configure sender email settings
5. Set email quota limits
6. Save

### Viewing Client Analytics
1. Navigate to `/clients/`
2. Click "View" (eye icon) on any client
3. See client details, campaigns, and usage statistics

### Managing Client Status
1. Navigate to `/clients/`
2. Click "Toggle Status" (power icon)
3. Confirm in modal
4. Client is activated/deactivated

## API Endpoints

For programmatic access:

```javascript
// Get all clients
GET /clients/api/list
Response: {clients: [...]}

// Get single client
GET /clients/api/<client_id>
Response: {client: {...}}

// Get statistics
GET /clients/api/stats
Response: {
  total_clients: 10,
  active_clients: 8,
  total_campaigns: 45,
  ...
}
```

## Testing Checklist

## Future Enhancements (Pending)

From TODO list:
- [ ] Update `new_campaign.html` with client selector dropdown
- [ ] Update `routes/campaigns.py` to auto-populate sender info from selected client

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Clients link not appearing in navigation
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart Flask to clear template cache

### Issue: 404 error on /clients route
**Solution:**
1. Verify clients_bp is imported in app.py (line 21)
2. Verify clients_bp is registered (line 88)
3. Kill all Python processes and restart
4. Clear Python bytecode cache: `rm -rf **/__pycache__`

### Issue: Database errors about client_id column
**Solution:**
1. Run migration script: `python migrate_existing_db.py`
2. Restart Flask
3. Check database schema with SQLite browser
